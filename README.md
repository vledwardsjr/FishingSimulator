# Fishing Simulation Game

A JavaScript-based simulation game centered on inventory management,
progression systems, and probability-driven outcomes.

The project models game state transitions such as item acquisition,
resource tracking, and upgrades, with an emphasis on scalable logic
and maintainable system design.

---

## Core Functionality

- Inventory tracking for collected items
- Probability-based outcome mechanics
- Progression systems tied to in-game currency and upgrades
- Persistent game state management
- Modular logic supporting feature expansion

---

## Technical Stack

- JavaScript
- Game State Management
- Probability Systems
- Data-Driven Logic

---

## Design Focus

This project emphasizes:
- Clear separation of game systems (inventory, economy, progression)
- Predictable state transitions across gameplay actions
- Extensible mechanics suitable for future features
- Maintainable logic over hardcoded behavior

---

## Use Case

Developed as a systems-focused simulation project to practice managing
complex application state and modeling real-time interactions in a game
environment.

---

## Project Status

Complete.  
Designed to support future enhancements such as additional items,
new mechanics, or a visual UI layer.
